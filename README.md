# Lean Buckner Child Theme

## Description

This is a custom child theme kit for [Lean](http://leantheme.co), crafted by [Jason Bradley](http://jasonbradley.me).

The [Lean Buckner](https://github.com/keithklingen/lean-buckner) requires Lean Theme.

## Installation

*Note: Lean Theme must be installed first for the Lean Buckner to work correctly.*

There are two ways to install WordPress themes / child themes: via the WordPress Dashboard (recommended) and via FTP. 

### Using the WordPress Dashboard

1. Download the [Lean Lean Buckner](https://github.com/keithklingen/lean-buckner).
2. Locate the "Appearance" menu.
3. In the "Appearance" menu, click on "Themes".
4. On the "Themes" page, click on the "Install Themes" tab.
5. Click on the "Upload" link at the top of the page.
6. On the "Upload" page, locate the theme / child theme archive (zip) on your computer and click "Install Now".
7. On the following page, click "Activate".

### Using FTP

1. Download the [Lean Buckner](https://github.com/keithklingen/lean-buckner).
2. Unzip the ```lean-buckner.zip``` archive on your computer.
3. Connect to your server via FTP.
4. Upload the extracted ```lean-buckner``` directory to the ```/wp-content/themes/``` directory on your server.
6. In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to the "Themes" page under the "Appearance" menu.
7. Locate "Lean Blank Canvas" and click "Activate".

## Usage

Find the ```style.css``` file for the Lean Blank Canvas and locate the "Customizations" section. You can add your own styles under this section to override the styles that come with Standard.

If you happened to name Lean Theme theme directory anything else besides "lean" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the child theme's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.
